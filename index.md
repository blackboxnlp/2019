## Travel awards

We will have a limited number of travel awards for students whose papers were accepted for publication in the workshop, thanks to generous support from Microsoft, Google and Facebook. We will prioritize students with limited financial resources (e.g., who work in low-income countries or in graduate programs that are not well-funded). A link to the application website will be made available after acceptance notifications have been sent out. The deadline for applications ~~is May 27~~ has passed.

## Description

Neural networks have rapidly become a central component in NLP systems in
the last few years. The improvement in accuracy and performance brought by
the introduction of neural networks has typically come at the cost of our
understanding of the system: How do we assess what the representations and
computations are that the network learns? The goal of this workshop is to
bring together people who are attempting to peek inside the neural network
black box, taking inspiration from machine learning, psychology,
linguistics, and neuroscience. The topics of the workshop will include, but
are not limited to:

- Applying analysis techniques from neuroscience to analyze
high-dimensional vector representations (such as Haxby et al., 2001;
Kriegeskorte, 2008) in artificial neural networks;
- Analyzing the network's response to strategically chosen inputs in order
to infer the linguistic generalizations that the network has acquired
(e.g., Linzen et al., 2016; Loula et al., 2018);
- Examining the performance of the network on simplified or formal
languages (e.g., Hupkes et al., 2018; Lake et al., 2018);
- Proposing modifications to neural network architectures that can make
them more interpretable (e.g., Palanki et al., 2017);
- Scaling up neural network analysis techniques developed in the
connectionist literature in the 1990s (Elman, 1991);
- Testing whether interpretable information can be decoded from
intermediate representations (e.g., Adi et al.,  2017; Chrupala et al.,
2017; Hupkes et al., 2017);
- Translating insights on neural networks interpretation from the vision
domain (e.g., Zeiler & Fergus, 2014) to language;
- Explaining model predictions (e.g., Lei et al., 2016; Alvarez-Melis &
Jaakkola, 2017): What are ways to explain specific decisions made by neural
networks?
- Adversarial examples in NLP (e.g., Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Belinkov &
Bisk, 2018): How to generate them and how to evaluate their quality?
- Open-source tools for analyzing neural networks in NLP (e.g., Strobelt et
al., 2018; Rikters, 2018).
- Evaluation of analysis results: How do we know that the analysis is
valid?

BlackboxNLP 2019 is the second BlackboxNLP workshop. The programme and
proceedings of the previous edition, which was held at EMNLP 2018, can be
found [here](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/2018/).


## Submission

We accept two types of papers

- Archival papers. These are papers reporting on completed, original and
unpublished research, with maximum length of 8 pages + references. Papers
shorter than this maximum are also welcome. An optional appendix may appear after the references in the same pdf file. Accepted papers are expected to
be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop
proceedings. They should report on obtained results rather than intended
work. These papers will undergo double-blind peer-review, and should thus
be anonymized. Archival papers will be included in the workshop proceedings 
and the ACL anthology.

- Extended abstracts. These may report on work in progress or may be cross
submissions that have already appeared in a non-NLP venue. The extended
abstracts are of maximum 2 pages + references. These submissions are
non-archival in order to allow submission to another venue. The selection
will not be based on a double-blind review and thus submissions of this
type need not be anonymized. Abstracts will be posted on the workshop website
but will not be included in the proceedings.

Both papers and abstracts should follow the official ACL 2019 style guidelines and should be submitted via softconf:

[https://www.softconf.com/acl2019/blackboxnlp](https://www.softconf.com/acl2019/blackboxnlp)

Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop: most as posters, some as oral presentations (determined by the program committee).

### Dual submissions
Dual submissions of archival papers with other venues are allowed. Please let us know as soon as possible if 
you decide to withdraw a paper accepted elsewhere. Also please consider that dual submissions increase reviewing burden 
for the whole community.

### Preprints
Papers posted to preprint servers such as arxiv can be submitted without any restrictions on when they were posted.



## Organizers

### Tal Linzen
Tal Linzen (tal.linzen@jhu.edu) is an Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University. He develops computational cognitive models of language. In addition to his work in psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience, he has studied the syntactic capabilities of contemporary artificial neural networks and the linguistic information encoded in word embeddings, in work that has appeared in TACL, EACL and CoNLL. He has co-organized the first edition of BlackboxNLP, and has also organized two editions of the workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics, co-located with EACL 2017 and with SCiL 2018.

### Grzegorz Chrupała
Grzegorz Chrupała (g.chrupala@uvt.nl) is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence at Tilburg University. His research focuses on computational models of language learning from multimodal signals such as speech and vision and on the analysis and interpretability of representations emerging in
multilayer neural networks. His work has appeared in venues such as *Computational Linguistics*, ACL, EMNLP and CoNLL. He has served as area chair for ACL, EMNLP and CoNLL and he co-organized the first edition of BlackboxNLP.

### Yonatan Belinkov
Yonatan Belinkov (belinkov@seas.harvard.edu) is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). 
His recent research focuses on representations of language in neural network models, with applications in machine translation and speech recognition. 
His research has been published at ACL, EMNLP, TACL, ICLR, and NeurIPS. 
His PhD dissertation at MIT analyzed internal language representations in deep learning models. 

### Dieuwke Hupkes
Dieuwke Hupkes (d.hupkes@uva.nl) is a PhD student at the University of Amsterdam.
The main focus of her research is understanding how recurrent neural networks can understand and learn the structures that occur in natural language.
Developing methods to interpret and interact with neural networks has therefore been an important area of focus in her research.
She authored 5 articles directly relevant to the workshop, one of them published in a top AI journal (Journal of Artificial Intelligence), and she is co-organizing a workshop on compositionality, neural networks, and the brain to be held at the Lorentz Center in the summer of 2019.
